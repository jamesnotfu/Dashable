### Connecting to IFTTT
The following action will teach you how to create an IFTT action with the IFTTT Maker Webhooks platform. 

1. You will first need to sign up and create an account at the URL https://ifttt.com/.

2. After creating your account, click the search button. Search for Maker Webhooks, and then press the connect button.

3. Go to 'My Applets'.

4. Create a new applet by selecting the 'New Applet' option.

5. Click on the this text/button. Search for Maker Webhooks, and select it. If this step does not work, you might want to refer back to step two.

6. You will be prompted to a screen that asks you to choose a trigger. Choose the 'Receive a web request' trigger, and create a new event name. You can name it anything you want!

7. Click on the 'that' button. You will be prompted to a screen, with many options, all of which you can choose to trigger when the Dash button is pressed. A few of the ones I recommend trying are the SMS, Phone Call and Philips Hue
